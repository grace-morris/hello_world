# hello_world
My First Repository
I'm a CS student at Truman State trying to learn GitHub.
I'm also looking for an internship for Summer 2021!
You can find me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-morris-4a88801b7/
Also check out my organization Truman ACM!
We are currently creating a website for Mainstreet Kirksville.
I hope you are happy and healthy in these hard times.
